# FreeBSD Community and User Questions

These questions will be used to create documentation either in the Wiki, Handbook or elsewhere that isn't currently covered, or covered adequately. We're particularly interested in questions that relate to aspects of the project that involve non-committers. Please feel free to propose a new section or category if the existing ones do not suffice, eg: "Conferences".
