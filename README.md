# FreeBSD Community and User Questions

This is a list of user-generated questions on particular topics that will be used/referenced to create documentation either in the Wiki, Handbook or elsewhere that isn't currently covered, or covered adequately. 

* Edit (fork) this file (README.md)
* Add your question(s) to the most relevent section
* Create a Pull Request

We're particularly interested in questions from users that relate to aspects of the project that involve non-committers.

Please feel free to propose a new section or category if the existing ones do not suffice, eg: "Conferences".
