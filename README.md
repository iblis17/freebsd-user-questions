# FreeBSD Community and User Questions

This is a list of user-generated questions on particular topics (please create a PR to add yours!) that will be used/referenced to create documentation either in the Wiki, Handbook or elsewhere that isn't currently covered, or covered adequately. 

We're particularly interested in questions from users that relate to aspects of the project that involve non-committers.

Please feel free to propose a new section or category if the existing ones do not suffice, eg: "Conferences".
